# bash_profile
The source of what I started with is from this smart fellow:
https://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/
I just added some coler based on exit codes from here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16715103/bash-prompt-with-last-exit-code
And I used https://ipv4.icanhazip.com to force the eternal IP address for when using "ii" at the prompt.
More changes to come soon, but please chek out the top two links.  Very informative.
